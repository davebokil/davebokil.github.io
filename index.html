      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/dave.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Dave has many minutes (soon to be hours) of experience coding websites. He was totally not frustrated at all trying to style this particular one. When he's not scouring tutorials and stackoverflow for coding direction, he can be found at the piano, where he enjoys playing all genres and styles.</p>

      <p>Dave is currently embarking on a full stack development intensive at Rutgers University. He hopes these skills will compliment and enhance his background in music technology and sound design. Stay tuned for some exciting additions to his portfolio page, where he aims to bring some unique and creative web app ideas to reality!</p>
